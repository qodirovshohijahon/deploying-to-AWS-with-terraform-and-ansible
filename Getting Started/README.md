### Terraform
**- Terraform is not tied into one cloud vendor that's it works across all popular cloud providers**
**- Easy to use among team members**
**- Easy to write , declarative syntax templates in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language)**
**- It offers built-in fuctions modules and providers for working with cloud and on-prem systems**



### Ansible
**- A hybrid *configuration management* and *infrastructure deployment* tool**
**- It is not stateful like terraform & cloudformation** It does not keep track of what it deployed and changed before. On every run it will compare current state of the system with the template which is trying to deploy and normalize it
**- Agentless, it can give access cloud provider APIs for infra deployment and SSH for managing on prem systems**
